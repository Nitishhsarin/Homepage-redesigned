# Homepage-redesigned
A default Landing Page for your Browser

This minimal design webpage will serve as your main Landing page whenever you open your browser or create a New Tab. You can group together all your important and frequently visited links at one place!

To set things up, 
1. Download this repository.

2. Edit the index.html file with links according to your browsing pattern.

3. Install any New Tab Redirection extension for your browser. ( I have used the New Tab Redirect for Chrome --> https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/new-tab-redirect/icpgjfneehieebagbmdbhnlpiopdcmna )

4. Open the extension options and in the Redirection URL box, type the location of the downloaded index.html file.

5. Open Chrome Settings and under "On startup" Heading, select Open the new tab page. (Allow the extension to control the new tab behaviour)

6. Enjoy :)
